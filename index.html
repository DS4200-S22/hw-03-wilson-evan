            <p>In this visualization the data would be sequential quantitative attributes.  This can be seen based on the heights of each bar.  However, the bucket sizes represents another sub division of the data that is also sequential quantitative data. The marks are the areas within each of the bars and height of the bars. The channels are the vertical lengths, horizontal position, the colors, and the area of each category within each bar. The marks within the stacked bar chart are item/nodes. </p>

        <div> <p>In this visualization the data shown would be categorical data. Each idea would be a subdivision of the theme or category. The marks are lines that connect the attributes to the category. The area is what represent the attributes and the categories. The channels are lines, area, and colors. The marks within the mind map are connection links.</p> </div>

        <div> 
            <p>In this visualization years are sequential attributes. As each letter progress through the years it moves between each number which is also a sequential attribute. The marks are the dotted points in lined length. The different ways to control the apperance are color, the horizontal and vertical position, and the length. Marks are used as links between the attributes.

        <div> <p> In this visualization each bubble is divided into 3 sections of quantitative sequential data. The 4th data piece is categorical and lies within each bubble. The limits of the data are marked on both the x and y axis. The marks are the size of the area. The channels are the colors within the graph, the area of the bubbles, the tilt within each section of the bubble, and the positions of the bubbles. The marks within the bubble and pie chart are item/nodes.</p> </div>
