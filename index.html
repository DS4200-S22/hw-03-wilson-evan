            <p>In this visualization the data would be sequential quantitative attributes.  This can be seen based on the heights of each bar.  However, the bucket sizes represents another sub division of the data that is also sequential quantitative data. The marks are the areas within each of the bars and height of the bars. The channels are the vertical lengths, horizontal position, the colors, and the area of each category within each bar. </p>

        <div> <p>In this visualization the data shown would be categorical data.  Each idea would be a subdivision of the theme or category.

            <p>In this visualization years are sequential attributes. As each letter progress through the years it moves between each number which is also a sequential attribute.  The marks are the dotted points in lined length. The different ways to control the apperance are color, the horizontal and vertical position, and the length.  Marks are used as links between to attributes.

        <div> <p> In this visualization each bubble is divided into 3 sections of quantitative sequential data. The limits of the data is marked on both the x and y axis.  The marks are the size of the area.  Finally, the channels are the colors of the graph. </p> </div>
